## Speech Analysis with Parselmouth and Visualization Tools

This project demonstrates how to perform basic speech analysis using the `parselmouth` library and visualize the results using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `pandas`. The analysis includes plotting waveforms, spectrograms, intensity, pitch, and formants of an audio file.

### Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:

- `parselmouth`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `pandas`

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install parselmouth numpy matplotlib seaborn pandas
```

### Analysis Steps

1. **Load and Plot Waveform:** Load the audio file and plot its waveform.
2. **Plot Spectrogram and Intensity:** Draw the spectrogram and intensity of the sound.
3. **Plot Pitch:** Draw the pitch (fundamental frequency) of the sound.
4. **Plot Formants:** Perform formant analysis and plot the formants.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use the `parselmouth` library for speech analysis and visualize various speech parameters using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `pandas`. You can extend this project to include more advanced analyses and visualizations as needed.
